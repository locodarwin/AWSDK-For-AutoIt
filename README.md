# AWSDK-For-AutoIt
A wrapper for the Activeworlds SDK that allows creation of bots using the AutoIt scripting language.

For usage instructions, visit the wiki: https://powergod.org/aw/doku.php?id=awsdk:sdkmain

At a minimum, to create Activeworlds "bots" using AutoIt you'll need to download these files:

  * AWSDK4AU_Constants.au3 
  * AWSDK4AU_UDF.au3 

The optional AWSDK4AU_ReturnCodes.au3 file is used to return the plain-English text from the success/error (rc) codes returned by the Activeworlds API. For troubleshooting during development and use of AWSDK For AutoIt scripting, the use of this file is highly recommended.

Download the SimpleGreeterBot.au3 (heavily commented) and/or SimpleGreeterBot - SansComments.au3 files for testing, demonstration, and tutorial purposes.

Download the GUI Sample.au3 script for a demonstration of GUI bot scripting in AWSDK For AutoIt.
